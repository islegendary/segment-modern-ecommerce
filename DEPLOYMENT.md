- [x] Segment analytics integration ready

### ✅ Performance
- [x] Production build successful
- [x] Images properly optimized

- [x] Fast loading times

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare Repository
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: complete e-commerce platform with video integration and Vercel optimization"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Vercel Deployment
1. Connect GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Import project (auto-detects Vite configuration)
3. Deploy with default settings
4. Verify all assets load correctly

### 3. Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Home page loads with video animation
- [ ] All product images display correctly
- [ ] Shopping cart functionality works
- [ ] Offers page displays TitanOffer.png
- [ ] Responsive design on mobile/tablet
- [ ] Analytics tracking functions (check console)

## Environment Variables

Leave unset to log events in the console only. Set a real key to keep that console output and also send events:

```
VITE_SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY=your_actual_write_key_here
```

You can also paste the key in `src/analytics.js` for a live demo.

## Troubleshooting

### Images Not Loading
- Verify assets are in `/public/assets/` folder
- Check image paths use `/assets/` not `/src/assets/`
- Ensure case-sensitive filenames match

### Video Not Playing
- Check browser autoplay policies
- Verify video file is in `/public/assets/`
- Ensure video is properly encoded (H.264 recommended)

### Build Errors
- Run `npm run build` locally first
- Check for any missing dependencies
- Verify all imports are correct

## Success Metrics

Your deployment is successful when:
- ✅ Build completes without errors
- ✅ All pages load under 3 seconds
- ✅ Video plays automatically on home page
- ✅ All product images load correctly
- ✅ Shopping cart maintains state
- ✅ Mobile experience is smooth
- ✅ Analytics events fire correctly

## Support

For deployment issues:
1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Verify all assets are committed to repository
3. Test production build locally with `npm run preview`
4. Ensure no hardcoded localhost URLs
